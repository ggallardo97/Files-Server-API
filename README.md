# Files Server

An API that allows you to interact with a files server (it's like FTP, but you cannot download files, only upload them). I took the idea from a youtube video, so I decided to make my own project to upload files from every divice connected to my network.

## Technologies involved
- JavaScript - Nodejs
- Express
- MongoDB
- JWT
- npm modules

## Installation

First of all, you need to have installed Nodejs and MongoDB, then clone this repo and install the required npm modules. Here are some commands that will help you:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ggallardo97/Files-Server-API
  cd Files-Server-API
  node index.js
```
Second step, create an .env file with the following info:
- API_URL = '/api/v1'
- CONNECTION_DB = 'yourDBConnectionHere'
- JWT_SECRET = 'yourSecretHere'

Finally, use Postman (or another one) to use it.
